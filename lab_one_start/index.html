        <p> 
            I was born and Montreal and moved to Ontario when i was 7. After a highschool I moved to the west coast and had some great
            experiences. I moved back to Ontario in 2017 and went to school for policing. Afterwards, I decided wasn't the career that was right 
            for me and worked for a bit trying to figure out my path. I decided that I wanted to work in tech as I've always loved computers.
            My job history list would probably need two pages so I'm excited to hopefully be in a field of work that I love and enjoy. I enjoy 
            Gaming, travelling, camping and chilling with my cat Moo, who I've had for around 5 years now.
